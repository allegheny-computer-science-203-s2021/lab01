## Summary

Designed for use with [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/), this
repository contains the starter for Laboratory 1 in Computer Science 203. As
part of this assignment, you should answer all of the questions in the
`reflection.md` file, furnishing evidence of your contributions to the project.
Students who have questions about this task should talk with a student technical
or the course instructor. Before the due date for this project, please ensure
that:

- You made significant contributions to the shared GitHub repositories for both
  the Code of Conduct and the Assessment Guide.

- The build status for the shared GitHub repositories for both the Code of
  Conduct and the Assessment Guide are passing.

- The GitHub repositories for the Code of Conduct and the Assessment Guide do
  not have any open, unresolved issues in them.

- This GitHub repository contains a complete reflection file.

- You have followed the required best practices for asking the course instructor and technical leaders for feedback on the work that you completed for this laboratory assignment.

## Objectives

* To develop a code of conduct and assessment guide governing how all members of Software Engineering class will interact during class, lab and practical sessions, as well as when working in a team, and how they will be assessed.

* To learn how to use GitHub and the GitHub Flow model to support collaboration among a team of software engineers.

* To learn how to use Markdown to complete technical writing tasks.

* To reflect on the process to be able to continue improving professional and technical skills.

## Reading Assignment

If you have not done so already, please read all of the relevant [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/)
that explain how to use many of the features
that GitHub provides. In  particular,  please  make  sure  that  you  have  read
guides  such  as  "Mastering  Markdown"  and "Documenting Your Projects on GitHub";
each of them will help you to understand how to use both GitHub and GitHub Classroom.
You are also expected to read [ACM's Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics). Please see the course instructor if you have questions on these reading assignments.

Please watch a video introducing the Code of Conduct development on YouTube: [![Code Of Conduct Assignment Introduction](CodeOfConduct_YouTubeThumbnail_small.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNwsIX8TJE8&list=PLz9YRLfRGO9JpJfVknMPnK_jagA0mgxN0&index=1&t=13s)

## Creating the Code of Conduct Guide

### Accessing the Repository

All class members are going to work in the same
[Code of Conduct repository](https://github.com/allegheny-computer-science-203-s2021/CodeOfConduct) following
[GitHub flow model](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flow/) to collaboratively develop and improve
the conduct guide.

### Tasks

For the code of conduct portion of the laboratory assignment,  your  task  is  to  collaborate  with  the
members  of  your  class  to  write  a  full-featured code of conduct, using
the GitHub Flow model to facilitate collaboration. You should first read the
[ACM's Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics) that all computer
scientists are expected to follow. Using this broad standard as the baseline,
you should then describe specific student and instructor behaviors
that are deemed to be acceptable and unacceptable in this course.
Make sure that you explain how the class will handle infractions of the conduct
guide.

Please note that you should use repository branches and pull requests
to ensure that your  work  is  ultimately  added  to  the  repository's  master
branch.   When  you  follow  the  GitHub Flow model you should create a separate
"feature branch" in your GitHub repository that contains additions or changes
that you want to make to the code of conduct.  Using appropriate commit messages,
you will repeatedly commit to this branch until you have finished the feature.  Now, you
will  use  GitHub  to  raise  a  pull  request,  tagging  the  course  instructor
and  the  student  technical leaders and asking them review your work.
Once you have resolved all of the concerns raised by the reviewers of your pull
request and it is approved, a  member  of  your  team  should  merge  it  into
the  main  branch  of  the  GitHub  repository.   At this point,  you can
delete the feature branch from the repository and start working on the next
task associated with completing this project.

## Creating the Assessment Guide

### Accessing the Repository

All class members are going to work in the same
[assessment repository](https://github.com/allegheny-computer-science-203-s2021/assessment) following
[GitHub flow model](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flow/) to collaboratively develop and improve
the assessment guide.

### Tasks

For the assessment guide portion of the laboratory assignment,  your  task  is  to  collaborate  with  the
members  of  your  class  to  write  a  full-featured assessment, using
the GitHub Flow model to facilitate collaboration.

As with the conduct guide, please use repository branches and pull requests
to ensure that your  work  is  ultimately  added  to  the  repository's  main branch.

### Team Work

Each member of the class will be randomly assigned to a team at the beginning
of the lab session. Each team will be assigned one feature/section to start
with, however all teams are expected to make contributions to all sections of the conduct
guide. It is expected that each team may revisit each section multiple times.
For example, if you make a change to another team's writing, you are expected to
invite them to review your changes using appropriate GitHub method.

Your team should use GitHub and its features (e.g., issue tracker, pull requests,
commit log, and code review request) to complete all of the tasks referenced in
the previous section.  Aiming to manage risk and estimate the effort required for
individual team members to complete this project, you should assign people to
teams, roles, and tasks.  While it is acceptable for you to have Zoom
discussions with your team members or to talk about the project through Slack,
please remember that all important discussions and decisions must be also
documented through GitHub.

Since  multiple  approaches  may  support  the  effective  completion  of  the
required  documents, this assignment does not dictate team organization or
communication strategies.  The students in the course should instead work
with each other, the student technical leaders, and the instructor to identify
team roles and strategies for effective organization and communication.
Importantly, you should make sure that every student in the class makes a
contribution to the code of conduct GitHub repository.  By the end of the
laboratory session, the team should have identified roles for each student
in the class, thus ensuring that everyone has assigned tasks that will both
capitalize on their expertise and enhance their software engineering skills.
Please remember that GitHub Actions CI is configured to check the Markdown files in
the repository with "mdl".  If your writing meets all the established requirements
set by this linting tool, then you will see a green :heavy_check_mark: in the listing of
commits in GitHub after awhile.  If your submission does not meet the requirements,
a red :heavy_multiplication_x: will appear instead.  

## Assignment Assessment

The grade that a student receives on this assignment will have the following
components.

- **GitHub Actions CI Build Status [up  to 30%]:**: For each of three repositories associated with this assignment students will receive a checkmark grade if their last before-the-deadline build passes. Students are encouraged to repeatedly revise their submission to ensure that all relevant repositories receive a CI pass.

- **Mastery of Technical Writing [up  to 15%]:**: Students will also receive a checkmark grade
  when the responses to the technical writing questions presented in the
  `reflection.md` reveal a mastery of both writing skills and technical
  knowledge. To receive a checkmark grade, the submitted writing should have
  correct spelling, grammar, and punctuation in addition to following the rules
  of Markdown and providing technically accurate answers. Students are
  encouraged to ask the course instructor or a student technical leader to use
  the GitHub issue tracker to provide feedback on their mastery of technical
  writing skills.

- **Level of Contribution [up  to 30%]:**: Students will also receive a checkmark grade
  when their level of contribution indicates active engagement in the process of development
  of conduct and assessment guides. It is expected that each member of the class
  makes at least two commits with valuable contributions in each guide repository.

- **Mastery of Technical Knowledge and Skills [up  to 25%]**: Students will also receive a
  checkmark grade when their GitHub repository reveals that they have mastered
  all of the technical knowledge and skills developed during the completion of
  this assignment. As a part of this grade, the instructor will assess aspects
  of the project including, but not limited to, the use of effective Markdown
  syntax, correct use of GitHub flow practices, and appropriate Git commit messages.
  Students are encouraged to ask the course instructor or a student technical leader
  to use the GitHub issue tracker to provide feedback on how well their work demonstrates
  mastery of the assignment's technical knowledge and skills.

All grades for this project will be reported through a student's gradebook GitHub
repository.
